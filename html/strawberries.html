    <p class="text-top">Strawberries are an easy to grow fruit crop that 
        will reward the home gardener with ample harvests for many years.
        <br>With favorable conditions, each strawberry plant 
        should produce one quart of strawberries.</p>

            <p class="sub-head">Where to Plant Strawberries</p>
        <p>Basic considerations when locating a strawberry patch include</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Full sun</li>
            <li>Well drained, sandy loam with a soil pH from 5.8 to 6.2 is ideal</li>
            <li>Don't plant where tomatoes, potatoes, peppers or
                eggplant have been grown recently
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Start with a rich, organic soil. Apply a balnced fertilizer (10-10-10)
            at planting at the rate of one pound per 100 sq. ft. <br>Fertilize again after
            renovation of June bearers or second harvest of day neutrals and everbeaning types.
            Do not over <br>fertilizer or you will have excessive leaf growth and poor flowering.
            Do not fertilizer strawberries late in the season in <br>colder climate to prevent
         new growth that will be damaged by frost
